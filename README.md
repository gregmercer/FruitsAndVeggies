# FruitsAndVeggies

This branch is specifically setup so that you can debug into MvvmCross. Currently I've only set this up for iOS.

To use this branch you'll need to git clone the MvvmCross project into the root folder. 

```
git clone https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross
```

So the directory structure should look like this (after cloning MvvmCross):

```
/FruitsAndVeggies
/FruitsAndVeggies/MvvmCross
...
```

I'm currently using tag 5.0.2 of MvvmCross - so after cloning you'll need to git checkout 5.0.2 under the MvvmCross directory.

```
git checkout 5.0.2
```
